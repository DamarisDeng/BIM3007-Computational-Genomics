# BIM3007-Assignment
Assignment of BIM3007 (Computational Genomics and Proteomcis)

The requirement of each assignment is in the same folder. Usually named as Assignment x.pdf (or .word). My own work is shown in `.md` or `.tex` file.

The first assignment (in the `A1` folder) includes summaries about "Human genome project", "Evolution of Sequencing Techonology", "Exome-sequencing data analysis" and "Genome-wide association study".

The second assignment (in the `A2` folder) includes hands-on experience to polish and evaluate an E. coli genome, conduct NIPT data analysis and variant calling of whole-exome sequencing data.

The third assignment (in the `A3` folder) is to use PLINK to perform quality control steps and conduct genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the QCed data.
